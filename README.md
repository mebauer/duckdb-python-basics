# DuckDB in Python: A Beginner's Guide
Author: Mark Bauer

# 1. Introduction
Welcome to the beginner's guide to DuckDB's Python client! This tutorial was crafted during my own journey of acquainting with DuckDB's Python client and aims to provide newcomers with a basic foundation in utilizing the API. The [duckdb-python-basics](https://github.com/mebauer/duckdb-python-basics/blob/main/duckdb-python-basics.ipynb) notebook is based almost entirely on the official [DuckDB Python documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/python/overview) but in a Jupyter Notebook layout. The [data-analysis](https://github.com/mebauer/duckdb-python-basics/blob/main/data-analysis.ipynb) notebook provides a sample analysis of Green Infrastructure projects in NYC.

While this guide serves as a valuable resource, I encourage users to complement their learning with the [official documentation](https://duckdb.org/) available on DuckDB's website for a comprehensive understanding.

# 3. Data
NYC DEP Green Infrastructure Data: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/DEP-Green-Infrastructure/spjh-pz7h

>This dataset contains the locations and detailed information of green infrastructure practices in NYC neighborhoods built primarily through NYC Green Infrastructure Program initiatives. Green infrastructure (GI) collects stormwater from streets, sidewalks, and other hard surfaces before it can enter the sewer system or cause local flooding. The GI practice data contained in this dataset includes the location, program area, status, and type of GI.
