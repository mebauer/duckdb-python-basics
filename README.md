# DuckDB in Python: A Beginner's Guide
Author: Mark Bauer

# 1. Introduction
Welcome to the beginner's guide to DuckDB's Python client! This tutorial was crafted during my own journey of acquainting with DuckDB's Python client. It aims to provide newcomers with a solid foundation in utilizing the API. While this guide serves as a valuable resource, I encourage users to complement their learning with the official documentation available on DuckDB's website for a comprehensive understanding.
