# DuckDB in Python: A Beginner's Guide
Author: Mark Bauer

# 1. Introduction
Welcome to the beginner's guide to DuckDB's Python client! This tutorial was crafted during my own journey of acquainting with DuckDB's Python client and aims to provide newcomers with a basic foundation in utilizing the API. This guide is based almost entirely on the official [DuckDB Python documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/python/overview) but in a Jupyter Notebook layout.

While this guide serves as a valuable resource, I encourage users to complement their learning with the [official documentation](https://duckdb.org/) available on DuckDB's website for a comprehensive understanding.
